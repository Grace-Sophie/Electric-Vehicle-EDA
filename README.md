## Electric-Vehicle-EDA

### Overview

This project aimed to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, Segmentation Analysis, Feature Engineering and Data visualiation.
To accomplish this, the project employed a variety of Python libraries and techniques including data manipulation and analysis with pandas and numpy, as well as visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, and Plotly. The project's workflow included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Loaded and cleaned the dataset to remove unnecessary information and standardize the text.

2. **Analysis and Visualization:**  
   Performed EDA to understand data patterns and distribution.
